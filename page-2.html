                   <b>Virtually Invisible:</b> Hearing aids are now incredibly discreet. And some models sit entirely within the ear canal, making them invisible to other people. This means no-one needs to know you’re wearing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Rechargeable:</b>  With the latest hearing aids there’s no need to worry about changing batteries or requiring spares. Portable chargers and short charging times mean you can charge your hearing aids as easily as your mobile phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    <b> Bluetooth Connectivity:</b> Modern hearing aids pair wirelessly with your smartphone and other smart devices. This means making phone calls is easy. Plus, innovative apps can help you achieve optimal sound quality in all different environments.
